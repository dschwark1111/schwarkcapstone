              Hey there! Welcome to my corner of the internet. A little about me: I am an Air Force veteran turned military spouse, mama to two little boys, I am obssesed with chickens and homesteading and I love UX/UI design. My love started after I took a coding bootcamp and ever since then I have not stopped learning and growing. 
            </p>
            <p className="home--section-description">
              In addition to UX/UI, I have a long history in digital marketing and growing multiple six figure businesses. My business background coupled with my UX/UI skills make me an asset to your company. I have the ability to create an amazing customer experience while maximizing your digital marketing efforts.
