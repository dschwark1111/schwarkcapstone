1. Introduction
For my capstone project I will be creating a portfolio website utilizing React JS and deploying with Netlify. 
I choose this project because my goal is to become a UX/UI designer and I want to showcase projects I create/work on for future employers/clients. It can also be deployed and used as a template for others. 

2. Project Description
The portfolio will be a great template for other people to use to showcase their work. It is minimalistic, highlights their work and will be easy to customize. 

3. Industry and Target Audience
Anyone needing a portofolio that is clean, minimalistic and it is easy to customize.

4. Elevator Pitch
There are lots of people out there who don’t have the time or the knowledge to create an online portfolio. And lots of websites that offer customized portfolios are either too expensive, not responsive, too difficult to customize or are very busy and don’t showcase a person’s abilities. This template offers easy customization, it has a simple and minimalistic design and allows a person’s work to be the center of the portfolio and it is completely responsive. In addition, because it uses React JS it has a quicker load time. Last, the portfolio is equipped with email integration, a direct link to their LinkedIn and other social media platforms allows potential employers and clients to follow them on all major platforms and get a better understanding of who they are as a person.

5. Technical Overview
React JS
React components make life easier. On the UI side of things, it ensures visual consistency with reusable and interactive design elements. When it comes to UX, it fosters a seamless user experience with instant feedback and reduced load times.

10. Conclusion and Future Work
Proud of this project. It isn’t as elaborate as most projects, but I did it and I came to this bootcamp with absolutely no knowledge. 
I am not 100% confident in my coding, but I think this project helped me see it is possible with the knowledge I have gained in this class and by doing what so many of the instructors have stated we would do as developers, RESEARCH.
I plan to keep adding and updating projects and as I grow more confident in my coding I will add more features.
